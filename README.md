# Believe Me - Forex Trading Robot

This code represents the implementation of a Forex trading robot called 'Believe Me'. The robot is designed to trade multiple currency pairs simultaneously, based on predefined entry and exit criteria. This code serves as a sample and is not the official development of the product.

## Currency Pairs

The list of currency pairs for trading is defined in the `currencyPairs` array. The robot will trade the following currency pairs: 'EURCHF', 'EURGBP', 'USDCHF', 'GBPCHF', 'GBPCAD', 'EURAUD', 'GBPNZD', 'CADCHF', 'EURNZD', 'EURUSD'.

## Trading Parameters

The following trading parameters are defined:

- `stopLoss`: The stop loss in pips.
- `takeProfit`: The take profit in pips.
- `riskPercentage`: The percentage of the account balance to risk per trade.

## Account Information

The account balance is obtained using the `AccountInfoDouble` function. The risk amount is calculated by multiplying the account balance by the risk percentage.

## Trade Entry and Exit Criteria

The trade entry and exit criteria are defined in the `ShouldEnterTrade` and `ShouldExitTrade` functions, respectively. These functions should be customized to implement specific trading strategies.

## Opening Positions

The `OpenPositions` function iterates over each currency pair in the `currencyPairs` array and checks if a trade should be entered using the `ShouldEnterTrade` function. If a trade should be entered, the position size is calculated based on the risk amount. The position is then opened by calling the `OrderSend` function with the appropriate parameters.

## Closing Positions

The `ClosePositions` function iterates over each currency pair in the `currencyPairs` array and checks if a trade should be exited using the `ShouldExitTrade` function. If a trade should be exited, the function retrieves all open positions for the currency pair using the `PositionsTotal` and `PositionSelectByTicket` functions. The function then closes each position using the `OrderClose` function.

## Main Program Loop

The `OnTick` function serves as the main program loop. It calls the `OpenPositions` and `ClosePositions` functions on every tick.

## Script Program Start Function

The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the script. It sets the millisecond timer to 1000, indicating that the `OnTick` function should be called every second.
